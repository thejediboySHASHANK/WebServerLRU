## Motivation and Need of the Project

### Objectives
- **Understand the Working of Requests:** To grasp how requests are handled from our local computer to the server.
- **Handle Multiple Client Requests:** To manage simultaneous requests from various clients efficiently.
- **Concurrency and Locking:** To implement locking procedures for handling concurrency effectively.
- **Cache Mechanics:** To explore the concept of cache and its functions as utilized by browsers.

### What Does a Proxy Server Do?
- **Efficiency and Reduced Server Load:** A proxy server speeds up the process by reducing the load on the server side.
- **Restrict Access:** It can restrict users from accessing specific websites.
- **Anonymity:** A good proxy changes the IP address, making the client anonymous to the server.
- **Security Enhancements:** Modifications can be made to encrypt requests, enhancing security against illegal access.

### OS Components Used
- **Threading:** For handling multiple operations simultaneously.
- **Locks and Semaphore:** For managing access to resources among multiple threads.
- **Cache:** Implementation of Least Recently Used (LRU) algorithm for efficient cache management.

### Limitations
- **Cache Handling of Multiple Clients:** If a URL opens multiple clients itself, our cache will store each clientâ€™s response separately. This may result in only a partial response being sent from the cache, preventing the website from loading correctly.
- **Cache Size Limitation:** Fixed size of cache elements may prevent large websites from being stored in the cache.

### Future Extensions
- **Use of Multiprocessing:** This code can be adapted to use multiprocessing for improved efficiency through parallelism.
- **Selective Website Access:** Extend the code to control access to specific types of websites.
- **Handling of Different Request Types:** Implementation can be extended to handle various types of requests, such as POST.


## Overview

**WebServerLRU** is a robust, multi-threaded web proxy server implemented in C. It leverages the POSIX threads (pthreads) library to manage multiple client requests concurrently, ensuring efficient handling of network traffic. The server integrates key concepts from operating systems such as semaphores and mutexes to securely manage concurrent access to shared resources.

### Key Features

- **Multi-Threading**: Utilizes the pthreads library to enable simultaneous processing of multiple client requests.
- **Concurrency Control**: Employs mutexes and semaphores to ensure safe access to shared resources among threads.
- **HTTP Request Handling**: Each incoming connection triggers the creation of a new thread that processes the client's HTTP request using the `proxy_parse.h` library, and forwards it to the intended remote server.
- **Response Caching**: Implements an LRU (Least Recently Used) caching mechanism to optimize response times. The server checks this cache before forwarding requests to the remote server, reducing latency and network load.
- **Socket Programming**: Uses standard socket programming functions such as `socket()`, `bind()`, `listen()`, and `accept()` for server setup. Data transmission is handled through `send()` and `recv()` functions.
- **DNS Resolution**: Incorporates `gethostbyname()` to resolve hostnames to IP addresses, facilitating the handling of HTTP requests to various domains.

### How It Works

Upon launching, the server begins listening for incoming TCP connections. When a connection is established, it accepts the connection and spins off a new thread dedicated to handling that specific client. Each thread performs the following tasks:
- Parses the clientâ€™s HTTP request.
- Checks the cache for a stored response.
- If cached, returns the response directly to the client.
- If not cached, forwards the request to the designated remote server, retrieves the response, sends it back to the client, and stores it in the cache.

This architecture not only enhances the responsiveness of the proxy server but also significantly reduces unnecessary network traffic by serving repeated requests directly from the cache.


## Demo

- When website is opened for the first time `(url not found)` then cache will be missed.
- Then if you again open that website again then `Data is retrieved from the cache` will be printed.

## How to Run

```
$ git clone https://github.com/thejediboySHASHANK/WebServerLRU.git
$ cd WebServerLRU
$ make all
$ ./proxy <port no.>
```

- This code can only be ran in a Linux Machine or in WSL.
- Please disable your browser cache.
